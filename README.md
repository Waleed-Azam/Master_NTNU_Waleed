Master thesis code
contains Simulated data predicition
Data sets and all the stuff needed to explain my results from my master thesis.


The Data using SimObject NetFollowing is generated for the training of the Deep learning model. The data set name  DVLNetFollowingDataBeforePreprocessing, it is the data set before the pre-processing of the data. For more about the Raw data: https://github.com/Waleed-Azam/Master_NTNU_Waleed/blob/master/DVLNetFollowingDataBeforePreprocessing


The file SimObjectNetfollowingXml will give the information of the varaibles and objects has been used for the generation of the data. For more please visit about the simulator for the generation of the data: https://github.com/Waleed-Azam/Master_NTNU_Waleed/blob/master/SimObjectNetfollowingXml


The Simulated data using the FhSim which has been used for the data generation: https://github.com/Waleed-Azam/Master_NTNU_Waleed/blob/master/Master_SyntheticData_FhSim

The fishmodel simulated for many seconds, here only presented the movement of the fishes for 2 seconds, under files name FishBehaviour@1Second and FishBehaviour@2Second respectively, for more: https://github.com/Waleed-Azam/Master_NTNU_Waleed/blob/master/FishBehaviour%401Second


Syhtetic and STB data set, TRAINED model and the Predcitions under file Synthetic data and STB data_Predicitons https://github.com/Waleed-Azam/Master_NTNU_Waleed/blob/master/Synthetic_data_and_STB_data_Predicitons.ipynb
